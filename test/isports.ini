# Each port needs to be specified here for UNIX (file can be used on both 
# Windows and UNIX), and only these ports will be searched.  The search
# paths are as follows, in this order:
#
# (1) Directory specified in the ISPORTS_INI_DIR environment variable
# (2) Application's working directory
# (3) C:\dev             (/dev in UNIX)
# (4) C:\                (Windows only)
#
# Several port types may be specified:
#     - <text>                COM port
#     - <text>:<bluetooth>    COM port with Bluetooth device
#     - <number>              UDP port
#     - <IP address>:<port>:  TCP connection
